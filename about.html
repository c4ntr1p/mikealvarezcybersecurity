    <h2 style="color:lavender;"><center>About Me:</center></h2>
    <p style="color:lavender;">
        I graduated from Georgia State University with a BA in Anthropology, which laid my investigative foundation. In 2015 I joined the Kennesaw Police Department where I worked for six years in various roles. Some of my proudest achievements with the Kennesaw Police Department are as follows:</p>
    <p style="color:lavender;">
        -Officer of the Year, 2018<br>
        -Community Service Award, 2018<br>
        -Promoted to Detective, Special Victim's Unit 2019<br>
        -Life Saver's Award, 2020<br>
    </p>

        In October of 2021 I left Law Enforcement and became a full time stay-at-home dad. This was a wonderful opportunity to spend quality time with my son, but also allowed me the flexibility to begin my Master's program in Cybersecurity at Excelsior University. While in school I participated in the National Cyber League's Ethical Hacking competitions. One of my links at the bottom of this page is my score card! I learned a lot about using Open Source Intelligence, Network Surviellance, Hashing, Encoding, and more. It was a cool chance to hone some Red Team muscles.

        I completed my graduate program in the fall of 2024. I began working with a Eco-Tech startup called SOLARCODERS in early 2025, which is a digital cooperative of web developers, engineers, programmers, graphic designers, and more with an optimistic vision for the future. Our shared ethos is one of sustainability, environmental responsibility, and the healthy intersection of self-reliance and community. Q1 we have our company website in the development pipeline, along with an Environmental Events Web Application.
