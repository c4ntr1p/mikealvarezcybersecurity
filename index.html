    <h2 style="color:lavender;">About Me:</h2>
    <p style="color:lavender;">
        I graduated from Georgia State University with a BA in Anthropology, which laid my investigative foundation. Later, I joined the Kennesaw Police Department where I worked for six years in various roles. Some of my proudest achievements with the Kennesaw Police Department are as follows:</p>
    <p style="color:lavender;">
        -Officer of the Year, 2018<br>
        -Community Service Award, 2018<br>
        -Promoted to Detective, Special Victim's Unit 2019<br>
        -Life Saver's Award, 2020<br>
    </p>
    <p style="color:lavender;">
        In October of 2021 I left Law Enforcement and became a full time stay-at-home dad. This was a wonderful opportunity to spend quality time with my son, but also allowed me the flexibility to begin my Master's program in Cybersecurity at Excelsior University. While in school I participated in the National Cyber League's Ethical Hacking competitions. One of my links at the bottom of this page is my score card! I learned a lot about using Open Source Intelligence, Network Surviellance, Hashing, Encoding, and more. It was a cool chance to hone some Red Team muscles.

        I completed my graduate program in the fall of 2024. I'm interested in Digital Forensics, an area I got a lot of exposure to when I was a police officer. Pouring over documents, tracking person's location and activity via their network traffic and ISP, and database exfiltration were some of the fun things I got to do in the Digital Forensic world. I'm eager to learn more about that field!

    <h1 style="color:lavender;"><u>Current Projects</u></h1>
    <p style="color:lavender;">
        -Working my way through the CompTIA Security+ study guide<br>
    
        -This website! Which is built using HTML and JS. Its fun messing around with code somewhere I can break things without consequence. So if you visit this page and something's broken, I'm probably playing around. <br>
