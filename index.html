        <h2 style="color:lavender;">About Me:</h2>
        <p style="color:lavender;">
            I'm a passionate and dedicated worker, and if you'll indulge me I'd like to share my background with you. I graduated from Georgia State University with a BA in Anthropology, which laid my investigative foundation. Later, I joined the Kennesaw Police Department where I worked for six years in various roles. Some of my proudest achievements with the Kennesaw Police Department are as follows:</p>
        <p style="color:lavender;">
            -Officer of the Year, 2018<br>
            -Community Service Award, 2018<br>
            -Promoted to Detective, Special Victim's Unit 2019<br>
            -Life Saver's Award, 2020<br>
        </p>
        <p style="color:lavender;">
            In October of 2021 I left Law Enforcement and became a full time stay-at-home dad. This was a wonderful opportunity to spend quality time with my son, but also allowed me the flexibility to begin my Master's program in Cybersecurity at Excelsior University. While in school I participated in the National Cyber League's Ethical Hacking competitions. I learned a lot about using Open Source Intelligence, Network Surviellance, Hashing, Encoding, and more. It was a cool chance to hone some Red Team muscles.
        </p>  
        <p style="color:lavender;"> 
            I've been diving into mini-projects, which has been awesome because I love learning new things and exploring technology. Whether it's the practical applications of Offensive Security strategies I've learned using the game-ified virtual machine 'GreyHack', setting up a TCP server on my Raspberry Pi to send messages between it and my homelab desktop, or just learning the flexibility of the Python language; every day's incredibly exciting!
