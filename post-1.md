# Creating with Astro

<a href="/blog/">Back to Blog</a>

Published on: 03/25/2025

Part of the first steps of migrating from using Git Pages to Netlify, I've followed the step-by-step tutorial provided for the Astro WebDev tool. It has been very user friendly, and especially helpful to see the changes I make happen in real-time thanks to their developer server you launch yourself via the terminal. 

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

Continued improvement to my personal website.
