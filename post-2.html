This paper will follow the thinking points presented by my thesis statement in the following ways:
<ul>   
    <li>Discuss what Application Security is.</li>
    <li>Describe common web application vulnerabilities, exploits, and what causes them.</li>
    <li>How to identify malware in web applications</li>
    <li> Various coding languages and how they help in web security</li>
    <li>What companies are doing to make apps safe</li>
    <li>What freelancers are doing to help where enterprise companies cannot</li>
</ul>

Topics to Consider:
<ul>
    <li>How is application security distinct? Do we need to be so granular within cybersecurity?</li>
    <li>Dangers of XSS attacks; what causes them, and what they can do?</li>
    <li>Dangers of SQL Injection; what causes them, and what can they do?</li>
    <li>Bug Bounties, Burp Suite, and how to find vulnerabilities; metrics to show bug bounty programs work and make the environment safer.</li>
</ul>

## TL;DR<br>
